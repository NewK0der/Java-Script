const accountID = 11   //const value can't be change
let accountName = "Binit"   // let value can be chane but there is no hoisting
var city = "Durgapur" // used in previous version of js and can be hoisting
state = "West Bengal" // this will also work but, not a good practice 

console.log(accountID)
console.table([accountID, accountName, city, state])
